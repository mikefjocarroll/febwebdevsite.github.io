          Welcome to the homepage of my web development fake website. Here you
          can navigate to my Product or Contact page. 'Content for test git
          push' Here's the first page of 'Atlas Shrugged' to fill out the page
          and make it look nicer. The light was ebbing, and Eddie Willers could
          not distinguish the bum’s face. The bum had said it simply, without
          expression. But from the sunset far at the end of the street, yellow
          glints caught his eyes, and the eyes looked straight at Eddie Willers,
          mocking and still—as if the question had been addressed to the
          causeless uneasiness within him. “Why did you say that?” asked Eddie
          Willers, his voice tense. The bum leaned against the side of the
          doorway; a wedge of broken glass behind him reflected the metal yellow
          of the sky. “Why does it bother you?” he asked. “It doesn’t,” snapped
          Eddie Willers. He reached hastily into his pocket. The bum had stopped
          him and asked for a dime, then had gone on talking, as if to kill that
          moment and postpone the problem of the next. Pleas for dimes were so
          frequent in the streets these days that it was not necessary to listen
          to explanations and he had no desire to hear the details of this bum’s
          particular despair. “Go get your cup of coffee,” he said, handing the
          dime to the shadow that had no face. “Thank you, sir,” said the voice,
          without interest, and the face leaned forward for the moment. The face
          was wind-browned, cut by lines of weariness and cynical resignation;
          the eyes were intelligent. Eddie Willers walked in, wondering why he
          always felt it at this time of day, this sense of dread without
          reason. No, he thought, not dread, there’s nothing to fear; just an
          immense, diffused apprehension, with no source or object. He had
          become accustomed to the feeling, but he could find no explanation for
          it; yet the bum had spoken as he knew that Eddie felt it, as if he
          thought that one should feel it, and more: as if he knew the reason.
          Eddie Willers pulled his shoulders straight, in conscientious
          self-discipline. He had to stop this, he thought; he was beginning to
          imagine things. Had he always felt it? He was thirty-two years old. He
          tried to think back. No, he hadn’t; but he could not remember when it
          started. The feeling came to him suddenly, at random intervals, and
          now it was coming more often than ever. It’s the twilight, he thought;
          I hate the twilight.
